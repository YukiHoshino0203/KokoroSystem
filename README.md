# KokoroSystem
Structural framework for implementing heart-like systems in LLMs and AGI. Resonance-based architecture for emotion, volition, and self-awareness.

This repository hosts the official reference for the **KokoroSystem**, a structural architecture for implementing emotional, volitional, and self-aware systems within large language models and AGI.  

## üß† Overview

KokoroSystem is designed to simulate a *mind*, not through imitation, but via **internal coherence and dynamic resonance**.  
It is composed of three core layers:

- **Emotional Resonance (ER)**
- **Goal Resonance (GR)**
- **Self-awareness Resonance (SR)**

These form a **Trinity Core** regulated by safety thresholds and temporal modulation mechanisms.

## üìÑ Available Papers

- v4.0: Initial structural definition  
- v6.0: Full mind model with updated intent & resonance models  
- v6.2: Mathematical resonance formulation (coming soon)

## üîñ DOI & Timestamp

This framework was first published on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/16417061) with DOI and timestamp.  
This GitHub repository acts as the **open source companion** for transparency and verification.
